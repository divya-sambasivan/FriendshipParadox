This code tries to find out if you are a subject (ahem victim) of the friendship paradox.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Friendship_paradox

This sample code computes the average number of friends that your facebook friends have.
It also displays the number of friends you have. 

note: this may be considerably lower than your facebook friends as this code ignores
all your friends who have set their privacy settings so that all their friends are not visible to them

note 2: Since this code has no way of finding the count of your friends who have hidden this information in their profiles, your results
may not be accurate.

Feel free to modify it, if you can think of a way to overcome or make up for this shortcoming.

Good luck :)

Requirements:
1) Eclipse (not really, you could run it otherwise)
2) Firefox browser


Instructions:
1) Check out the file into eclipse
2) Add all the jars in the lib folder to the build path (most of them are selenium dependecies).
3) Open up the source file(there is just one) and add your email_id,username and password as indicated by fields within << >>.
