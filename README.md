FriendshipParadox
=================

The friendship paradox is the phenomenon first observed by the sociologist Scott L. Feld in 1991 that most people have fewer friends than their friends have, on average. This is a sample code to test if it works for you as well
This code tries to find out if you are a subject (ahem victim) of the friendship paradox.

This sample code computes the average number of friends that your facebook friends have.
It also displays the number of friends you have. 

note: this may be considerably lower than your facebook friends as this code ignores
all your friends who have set their privacy settings so that all their friends are not visible to you

note 2: Since this code has no way of finding the count of your friends who have hidden this information in their profiles, your results
may not be accurate.

Feel free to modify it, if you can think of a way to overcome or make up for this shortcoming.

Good luck :)

Requirements:
1) Eclipse (not really, you could run it otherwise)
